# CRUD-Bench Go Conversion - Detailed Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the detailed plan for converting the SurrealDB crud-bench tool from Rust to Go. The crud-bench is a comprehensive benchmarking tool designed to test and compare the performance of various SQL and NoSQL databases across different workloads including embedded, networked, and remote databases.

## Implementation Strategy

We'll follow a phased approach, starting with core functionality and a single database implementation (MySQL) to validate the architecture before expanding to other databases.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Structure

- [x] Initialize Go module and project structure
- [x] Set up basic directory structure as outlined in PRD
- [x] Create initial README.md and Makefile
- [x] Set up Go module dependencies for core libraries
- [x] Implement basic package structure and core interfaces

## Phase 2: CLI Interface Implementation

- [x] Create the root command in cmd/crud-bench/main.go using Cobra
- [x] Implement all command-line flags as specified in the PRD
- [x] Implement config parsing in internal/config/cli.go
- [x] Add validation for required parameters and parameter combinations
- [x] Create help documentation and usage examples

## Phase 3: Configuration System and Value Generation

- [x] Create the configuration parsing system in internal/config/
- [x] Implement the value generation engine in internal/generators/
- [x] Implement template parsing for dynamic data generation
- [x] Add key generation with support for integer and other key types
- [x] Implement value generation with support for all specified types
- [x] Implement the scan configuration parser
- [x] Add utility functions for generating sample data

## Phase 4: Docker Integration and Container Management

- [x] Create Docker integration in internal/docker/
- [x] Implement container lifecycle management
- [x] Add health check utilities
- [x] Implement image configuration
- [x] Add support for custom Docker images and privileged mode
- [x] Implement port mapping and network configuration
- [x] Add proper cleanup of containers after benchmarking

## Phase 5: Core Benchmark Engine and Interfaces

- [x] Create the benchmark engine interface
- [x] Implement the benchmark client interface
- [x] Create the benchmark runner with test execution logic
- [x] Implement metrics collection for timing measurements
- [x] Add results processing for aggregation and output

## Phase 6: Initial Database Implementation - MySQL

- [x] Create the base adapter structure in internal/databases/
- [x] Implement MySQL adapter using github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql
- [x] Add prepared statements for efficient queries
- [x] Support all CRUD operations
- [x] Implement scan operations
- [x] Add Docker container configuration
- [x] Implement connection pooling and health checks
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests

## Phase 7: Performance Testing and Validation (MySQL)

- [ ] Create benchmark test suite for MySQL
- [ ] Compare performance with Rust version using identical configurations
- [ ] Optimize MySQL adapter for performance
- [ ] Validate metrics collection accuracy
- [ ] Ensure proper resource cleanup
- [ ] Document MySQL-specific configuration options

## Phase 8: Additional Database Implementations (After MySQL Validation)

### Tier 1 Databases

- [ ] Implement SQLite adapter (embedded database)
- [ ] Implement PostgreSQL adapter (networked database)
- [ ] Implement MongoDB adapter (document database)
- [ ] Implement in-memory map adapter (baseline testing)
- [ ] Add dry-run adapter for testing without database operations

### Tier 2 Databases

- [ ] Implement Redis adapter
- [ ] Implement SurrealDB adapter
- [ ] Implement RocksDB adapter

### Remaining Databases

- [ ] Implement LMDB adapter
- [ ] Implement ReDB adapter
- [ ] Implement Fjall adapter
- [ ] Implement SurrealKV adapter
- [ ] Implement ArangoDB adapter
- [ ] Implement Neo4j adapter
- [ ] Implement ScyllaDB adapter
- [ ] Implement KeyDB and Dragonfly adapters

## Phase 9: Advanced Query and Scan Operations

- [ ] Implement full table scans with all field projections
- [ ] Add full table scans with ID field only
- [ ] Implement full table count queries
- [ ] Add scans with limits and projections
- [ ] Implement scans with limits and offsets
- [ ] Add range-based scans
- [ ] Implement filter-based queries with various projections
- [ ] Add indexed table queries where supported
- [ ] Implement relationship traversal (1-level and n-level)

## Phase 10: Performance Metrics Collection and Reporting

- [ ] Implement comprehensive performance metrics collection
- [ ] Add statistical analysis for percentiles and outliers
- [ ] Implement results output in JSON format
- [ ] Add console output with real-time progress
- [ ] Implement system information collection
- [ ] Create visualization helpers for console output

## Phase 11: Comprehensive Testing and Performance Validation

- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for all components
- [ ] Add integration tests for end-to-end functionality
- [ ] Perform benchmarking comparison with Rust version across all databases
- [ ] Optimize performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

## Phase 12: Documentation and Final Delivery

- [x] Complete database-specific documentation
- [x] Add usage examples for common benchmark scenarios
- [x] Update README.md with installation and quick start guide
- [ ] Document performance characteristics and comparison with Rust version
- [ ] Create build and test automation scripts
- [x] Finalize Makefile with common operations

## Progress Tracking

### Current Status

- Project initialization: Completed
